# devcontainer-use

`devcontainer-use` is a tool that helps you create and use development environments inside Docker containers. It utilizes the [devcontainer.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) file format with [devcontainer-cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) to build and run the Docker containers.

It let's you use different profiles to work inside the container, such as `nvim`.

## Usage

By default `devcontainer-use` will come with a default `nvim` profile. To use it, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
devcontainer-use nvim
```
or
```bash
devcontainer-use nvim ./path/to/project
```

This will build and run a Docker container with a NeoVim development environment. 

The container will be stopped automatically when you exit from the container's shell unless there is no other terminals attached to the container.

### Custom Profiles

Default `nvim` profile will be inside `~/.config/devcontainer-use/profiles/nvim.json`. You can create your own profiles by creating new JSON files inside `~/.config/devcontainer-use/profiles/`.

## Default Nvim Profile

Default `nvim` profile will install `nvim`, `lazyvim` and `lazygit` inside the container.

The NeoVim configuration inside the container will be stored in a separate directory on your host machine to avoid conflicts with your local NeoVim setup. By default, the configuration will be located at:

Host:
```
~/.config/devcontainer-use/nvim/config
```

Container:
```
~/.config/nvim
```
